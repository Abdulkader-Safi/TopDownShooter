# Physics Engine Integration Plan

Based on my research, I recommend integrating BepuPhysics v2 into your MonoGame project. Here's the implementation plan:

Phase 1: Setup and Basic Integration

1. Add BepuPhysics v2 NuGet packages to the project
2. Create physics abstraction layer to interface between MonoGame and BepuPhysics
3. Implement vector type conversions between MonoGame and BepuPhysics vector types
4. Set up basic physics world initialization in GameRoot

Phase 2: Entity Integration

1. Create physics components (RigidBodyComponent, ColliderComponent)
2. Integrate with existing Entity-Component system
3. Update existing collision system to work alongside BepuPhysics
4. Convert current collision shapes (AABB, Capsule) to BepuPhysics equivalents

Phase 3: Game Integration

1. Update PlayerController to use physics-based movement
2. Convert enemy AI to work with physics bodies
3. Implement physics-based projectiles and damage system
4. Add debug visualization for physics bodies and constraints

Phase 4: Testing and Optimization

1. Performance testing and optimization
2. Validate physics behavior with existing gameplay
3. Add physics-specific debug controls
4. Documentation and code cleanup

This plan maintains your current architecture while adding high-performance 3D physics capabilities.
